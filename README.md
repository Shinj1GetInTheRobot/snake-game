Basic retro Snake Game in JavaFX

Supports single player and multiplayer (Arrow Keys vs WASD).
Also can adjust the tick speed and how much the snakes grow per apple consumed.

The Multiplayer Game Model supports unlimited number of players, but I only designed the UI to support 2 players.

I can't be bothered to fix this because since the game can only be played on a single computer, it's impractical to have more than 2 players.
But it'd be really cool if I could setup a LAN network to allow for multiple computers to play at once.
Unfortunately I don't know how to do socket programming yet. I'll come back to this in the future.
